### About this chatroom
Cana studio, made this chatroom for **Cana devs, designers or follwers** to communicate with each other. This chatroom uses the following technologies:
* WebRTC, for secure data exchange
* Vue.js, for fast state management
* PeerJS, for simplicity of coding over WebRTC
* Localstorage API, for data persistency
* Bootstrap, for basic styling

**Have fun chatting in this chatroom, but be kind.**

### Why WebRTC and PeerJS?
Cana studio does not have any money and makes **it's projects** free and open-source to use and edit.
We use **PeerJS and WebRTC** so we don't have to **run and setup servers.** This makes this free and also private.
